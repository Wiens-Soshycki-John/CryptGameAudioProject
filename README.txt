This repo has two unity games, one which I have modified and an original.  The modified one is modified to meet audio requirements for an assignment for my Digital Audio Course.

SETUP
My Version of the Game is reasonably under in the MyVersion folder named TestImport.exe (forgot to change the project name), whereas the original version is expectedly in the OriginalVersion folder named 3DCryptbaseGame.exe.
